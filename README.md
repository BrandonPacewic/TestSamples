# Test Samples

Command line tools for creating and running competitive programming test samples.
This tool is part of my [Problem Manager](https://github.com/BrandonPacewic/ProblemManager).
The test samples script, similar to [dbrun](https://github.com/BrandonPacewic/DebugAndRun/),
will define my debug macro for testing (`DBG_MODE`). For more information on my 
testing macros check out my
[Competitive Programming Library](https://github.com/BrandonPacewic/CompetitiveProgramming)
and [Competitive Programming Templates](https://github.com/BrandonPacewic/CompetitiveProgrammingProblems/tree/mega/templates).
